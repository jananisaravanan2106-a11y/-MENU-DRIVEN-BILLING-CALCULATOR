🧾 Menu Driven Billing Calculator using Python
📌 Project Overview

The Menu Driven Billing Calculator is a simple Python-based project that allows users to perform basic billing and arithmetic operations through a menu-driven interface. This project is ideal for beginners to understand core Python concepts in a practical way.

🎯 Problem Statement

To design and implement a menu-driven billing calculator that enables users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, viewing the total bill amount, and exiting the program.

✅ Objectives

Perform basic billing calculations

Implement menu-driven programming

Understand Python operators and input/output

Apply loops and conditional statements

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python 3

IDE: VS Code / Python IDLE

🧠 Project Description

This project simulates a simple billing calculator. The user interacts with a menu to:

Add item costs to the bill

Subtract discounts

Multiply price by quantity

Divide amounts

View the total bill amount

Exit the program

The bill amount is updated after each operation based on the user’s choice.

🧮 Algorithm

Initialize the total bill amount

Display the billing menu

Read the user’s choice

Perform the selected operation

Update and display the bill amount

Repeat the process until the user exits

💻 Sample Python Code
price1 = float(input("Enter price of item 1: "))
qty1 = int(input("Enter quantity of item 1: "))

price2 = float(input("Enter price of item 2: "))
qty2 = int(input("Enter quantity of item 2: "))

amount1 = price1 * qty1
amount2 = price2 * qty2

total = amount1 + amount2
print("Total Bill Amount =", total)

🧪 Sample Output
Enter price of item 1: 50
Enter quantity of item 1: 2
Enter price of item 2: 30
Enter quantity of item 2: 1
Total Bill Amount = 130.0

🏁 Result

The menu-driven billing calculator successfully performs arithmetic operations and displays the correct total bill amount.
